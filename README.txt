This C# console program was created using Mono 4.2.1 and the MonoDevelop IDE version 5.10.

It uses a Factory pattern to create a Media object using interface inheritance. The same method calls produce different results (mainly in the format and genre options) depending on the subclass instantiated.

Try/catch statements and while loops are used throughout in an effort to avoid unhandled exceptions.

An overloaded KeyPlayer setter is used for instances where the musician, actor, or author only goes by one name.
